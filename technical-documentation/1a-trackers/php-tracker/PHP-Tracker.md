## 1. Overview

The [Snowplow PHP Tracker](https://github.com/snowplow/snowplow-php-tracker) allows you to track Snowplow events from your PHP apps and scripts.

There are three basic types of object you will create when using the Snowplow PHP Tracker: Trackers, Subjects and Emitters.

A subject represents a user whose events are tracked. A tracker constructs events and sends them to one or more emitters. Each emitter then sends the event to the endpoint you configure, a Snowplow collector.

The current flow of the PHP Tracker is illustrated below:

[[/technical-documentation/images/php-tracker-flow.png]]

<a name="init" />
## 2. Initialize

To instantiate a new Tracker instance we need to make sure the Snowplow Tracker classes are available.

Include these class aliases in your project:

```php
use Snowplow\Tracker\Tracker;
use Snowplow\Tracker\Subject;
use Snowplow\Tracker\Emitters\SyncEmitter;
```

We can now create our Emitter, Subject and Tracker objects.

<a name="create-tracker" />
### 2.1 Creating a Tracker

The most basic Tracker instance will only require you to provide the type of Emitter and the URI of the collector to which the Tracker will log events.

```php
$emitter = new SyncEmitter($collector_uri, "http", "POST", 10, false);
$subject = new Subject();
$tracker = new Tracker($emitter, $subject);
```

Other Tracker arguments:

| **Argument Name** | **Description**                      | **Required?** | **Default**        |
|-------------:|:-------------------------------------|:--------------|:------------------------|
| `emitters`      | The emitter to which events are sent          | Yes         | `None`        |
| `subject`       | The user being tracked                        | Yes         | `Subject()`   |
| `namespace`     | The name of the tracker instance              | No          | `None`        |
| `app_id`        | The application ID                            | No          | `None`        |
| `encode_base64` | Whether to enable [base 64 encoding] [base64] | No          | `True`        |

Another example using all of the allowed arguments:

```php
$tracker = new Tracker($emitter, $subject, "cf", "cf29ea", true);
```

<a name="emitters" />
#### 2.1.1 `emitters`

This can be either a single emitter or an array of emitters. The tracker will send events to all of these emitters, which will in turn send them on to a collector.

```php
$emitter1 = new SyncEmitter($collector_uri);
$emitter2 = new CurlEmitter($collector_uri, false, "GET", 2);

$emitter_array = array($emitter1, $emitter2);

// Tracker Init
$subject = new Subject();
$tracker1 = ($emitter1, $subject); # Single Emitter
$tracker2 = ($emitter_array, $subject); # Array of Emitters
```

For more information see [emitters](#emitter-class).

<a name="subject" />
#### 2.1.2 `subject`

The user which the Tracker will track. This will give your events user-specific data such as timezone and language. You change the subject of your tracker at any time by calling `updateSubject($new_subject_object)`. All events sent from this Tracker will now have the new subject information attached.

For more information see [subjects](#subject-class).

<a name="namespace" />
#### 2.1.3 `namespace`

If provided, the `namespace` argument will be attached to every event fired by the new tracker. This allows you to later identify which tracker fired which event if you have multiple trackers running.

<a name="app-id" />
#### 2.1.4 `app_id`

The `app_id` argument lets you set the application ID to any string.

<a name="base64" />
#### 2.1.5 `encode_base64`

By default, unstructured events and custom contexts are encoded into Base64 to ensure that no data is lost or corrupted. You can turn encoding on or off using the `encode_base64` argument.

<a name="subject-class" />
## 3. Subjects

The Subject object lets you send any additional information about your application's environment, current user etc to Snowplow.

To create a new subject:

```php
$subject = new Subject();
```

By default the subject has one piece information in it already, the platform ["p" => "srv"].

The Subject class contains a variety of 'set' methods to attach extra data to your event.

* [`setPlatform`](#set-platform)
* [`setUserId`](#set-user-id)
* [`setScreenRes`](#set-screen-res)
* [`setViewport`](#set-viewport)
* [`setColorDepth`](#set-color-depth)
* [`setTimezone`](#set-timezone)
* [`setLang`](#set-lang)
* [`setIpAddress`](#set-ip-address)
* [`setUseragent`](#set-user-agent)
* [`setNetworkUserId`](#set-network-user-id)
* [`setDomainUserId`](#set-domain-user-id)

These set methods can be called either directly onto a subject object:

```php
$subject = new Subject();
$subject->setPlatform("tv");
```

Or they can be called through the tracker object:

```php
$tracker->returnSubject()->setPlatform("tv");
```

<a name="set-platform" />
### 3.1 `setPlatform`

The default platform is "srv". You can change the platform of the subject by calling:

```php
$subject->setPlatform($platform);
```

For example:

```php
$subject->setPlatform("tv") # Running on a Connected TV
```

For a full list of supported platforms, please see the [[Snowplow Tracker Protocol]].

<a name="set-user-id" />
### 3.2 `setUserId`

You can set the user ID to any string:

```php
$subject->setUserId($id);
```

Example:

```php
$subject->setUserId("jbeem");
```

<a name="set-screen-res" />
### 3.3 `setScreenResolution`

If your PHP code has access to the device's screen resolution, then you can pass this in to Snowplow too:

```php
$subject->setScreenResolution($width, $height);
```

Both numbers should be positive integers; note the order is width followed by height. Example:

```php
$subject->setScreenResolution(1366, 768);
```

<a name="set-viewport" />
### 3.4 `setViewport`

If your PHP code has access to the viewport dimensions, then you can pass this in to Snowplow too:

```php
$subject->setViewport($width, $height);
```

Both numbers should be positive integers; note the order is width followed by height. Example:

```php
$subject->setViewport(300, 200);
```

<a name="set-color-depth" />
### 3.5 `setColorDepth`

If your PHP code has access to the bit depth of the device's color palette for displaying images, then you can pass this in to Snowplow too:

```php
$subject->setColorDepth($depth);
```

The number should be a positive integer, in bits per pixel. Example:

```php
$subject->setColorDepth(32);
```

<a name="set-timezone" />
### 3.6 `setTimezone`

This method lets you pass a user's timezone in to Snowplow:

```php
$subject->setTimezone($timezone);
```

The timezone should be a string:

```php
$subject->setTimezone("Europe/London");
```

<a name="set-lang" />
### 3.7 `setLanguage`

This method lets you pass a user's language in to Snowplow:

```php
$subject->setLanguage($language);
```

The language should be a string:

```php
$subject->setLanguage('en');
```

<a name="set-ip-address" />
### 3.8 `setIpAddress`

This method lets you pass a user's IP Address in to Snowplow:

```php
$subject->setIpAddress($ip);
```

The IP Address should be a string:

```php
$subject->setIpAddress('127.0.0.1');
```

<a name="set-user-agent" />
### 3.9 `setUseragent`

This method lets you pass a useragent in to Snowplow:

```php
$subject->setUseragent($useragent);
```

The useragent should be a string:

```php
$subject->setUseragent('Agent Smith');
```

<a name="set-network-user-id" />
### 3.10 `setNetworkUserId`

This method lets you pass a Network User ID in to Snowplow:

```php
$subject->setNetworkUserId($networkUserId);
```
The network user id should be a string:

```php
$subject->setNetworkUserId("network-id");
```

<a name="set-domain-user-id" />
### 3.11 `setDomainUserId`

This method lets you pass a Domain User ID in to Snowplow:

```php
$subject->setDomainUserId($domainUserId);
```
The domain user id should be a string:

```php
$subject->setDomainUserId("domain-id");
```

<a name="emitter-class" />
## 4. Emitters

We now support four different emitters: sync, socket, curl and an out-of-band file emitter. The most basic emitter only requires you to specify the type of emitter to be used and the collectors URI as parameters.

All emitters support both `GET` and `POST` as methods for sending events to Snowplow collectors. For the sake of speed we recommend using `POST` as the tracker can then bundle many events together into a single request.

It is recommended that after you have finished logging all of your events to run the following command:

```php
$tracker->flushEmitters();
```

This will empty the event buffers of all emitters associated with your tracker object and send any left over events. In future releases this will be an automatic process but for now it remains manual.

<a name="sync-emitter" />
### 4.1 Sync

The Sync emitter is a very basic synchronous emitter which supports both `GET` and `POST` request types.

By default this emitter uses the Request type POST, HTTP and a buffer size of 50.

Example emitter creation:

```php
$emitter = new SyncEmitter($collector_uri, "http", "POST", 50);
```

Whilst you can force the buffer size to be greater than 1 for a GET Request; it will not yield any performance changes as we can still only send 1 event at a time.

Constructor:

```php
public function __construct($uri, $protocol = NULL, $type = NULL, $buffer_size = NULL, $debug = false)
```

Arguments:

| **Argument** | **Description**                     | **Required?** | **Validation**          |
|-------------:|:------------------------------------|:--------------|:------------------------|
| `$uri`          | Collector URI                          | Yes           | Non-empty string  |
| `$protocol`     | Collector Protocol (HTTP or HTTPS)     | No            | String            |
| `$type`         | Request Type (POST or GET)             | No            | String            |
| `$buffer_size`  | Amount of events to store before flush | No            | Int               |
| `$debug`        | Whether or not to log errors           | No            | Boolean           |

<a name="socket-emitter" />
### 4.2 Socket

The Socket emitter allows for much faster transmission of Requests to the collector by allowing us to write data directly to the HTTP socket.  However this solution is still in essence a synchronous process and will block the execution of the main script.

Example Emitter creation:

```php
$emitter = new SocketEmitter($collector_uri, NULL, "GET", NULL, NULL);
```

Whilst you can force the buffer size to be greater than 1 for a GET Request; it will not yield any performance changes as we can still only send 1 event at a time.

Constructor:
```php
public function __construct($uri, $ssl = NULL, $type = NULL, $timeout = NULL, $buffer_size = NULL, $debug = NULL)
```

Arguments:

| **Argument** | **Description**                     | **Required?** | **Validation**          |
|-------------:|:------------------------------------|:--------------|:------------------------|
| `$uri`          | Collector URI                          | Yes           | Non-empty string  |
| `$ssl`          | Whether to use SSL encryption          | No            | Boolean           |
| `$type`         | Request Type (POST or GET)             | No            | String            |
| `$timeout`      | Socket Timeout Limit                   | No            | Int or Float      |
| `$buffer_size`  | Amount of events to store before flush | No            | Int               |
| `$debug`        | Whether or not to log errors           | No            | Boolean           |

<a name="curl-emitter" />
### 4.3 Curl

The Curl Emitter allows us to have the closest thing to native asynchronous requests in php. The curl emitter uses the `curl_multi_init` resource which allows us to send any number of requests asynchronously. This garners quite a performance gain over the sync and socket emitters as we can now send more than one request at a time.

On top of this we are also using a modified version of this **[Rolling Curl library][rolling-curl]** for the actual sending of the curl requests.  This allows for a more efficient implementation of asynchronous curl requests as we can now have multiple requests sending at the same time, and in addition as soon as one is done a new request is started.

Example Emitter creation:
```php
$emitter = new CurlEmitter($collector_uri, false, "GET", 2);
```

Whilst you can force the buffer size to be greater than 1 for a GET request, it will not yield any performance changes as we can still only send 1 event at a time.

Constructor:
```php
public function __construct($uri, $protocol = NULL, $type = NULL, $buffer_size = NULL, $debug = false)
```

Arguments:

| **Argument** | **Description**                     | **Required?** | **Validation**          |
|-------------:|:------------------------------------|:--------------|:------------------------|
| `$uri`          | Collector URI                          | Yes           | Non-empty string  |
| `$protocol`     | Collector Protocol (HTTP or HTTPS)     | No            | String            |
| `$type`         | Request Type (POST or GET)             | No            | String            |
| `$buffer_size`  | Amount of events to store before flush | No            | Int               |
| `$debug`        | Whether or not to log errors           | No            | Boolean           |

<a name="curl-emitter-defaults">
#### 4.3.1 Curl Default Settings

The internal emitter default settings are as follows:

- Rolling Window (Number of concurrent requests)
  - POST: 10
  - GET: 30
- Curl Buffer (Number of times we need to hit the emitters buffer size before sending)
  - POST: 50
  - GET: 250

These settings are currently not editable from the constructor; however the values are stored within a `Constants.class` if you must make changes.

<a name="file-emitter" />
### 4.4 File

The File Emitter is the only true non-blocking solution.  The File Emitter works via spawning workers which grab created files of logged events from a local temporary folder.  The workers then load the events using the same asynchronous curl properties from the above emitter.

All of the worker processes are created as background processes so none of them will delay the execution of the main script.  Currently they are configured to look for files inside created worker folders until there are none left and they hit their `timeout` limit, at which point the process will kill itself.

If the worker for any reason fails to successfully send a request it will rename the entire file to `failed` and leave it in the `/temp/failed-logs/` folder.

Example Emitter creation:
```php
$emitter = new FileEmitter($collector_uri, false, "POST", 2, 15, 100);
```

The buffer for the file emitter works a bit differently to the other emitters in that here it refers to the number of events needed before an `events-random.log` is produced for a worker.  If you are anticipating it taking a long time to reach the buffer be aware that the worker will kill itself after 75 seconds by default (15 x 5). Adjust the timeout amount in the construction of the FileEmitter if the default is not suitable.

Constructor:
```php
public function __construct($uri, $protocol = NULL, $type = NULL, $workers = NULL, $timeout = NULL, $buffer_size = NULL, $debug = false)
```

Arguments:

| **Argument** | **Description**                     | **Required?** | **Validation**          |
|-------------:|:------------------------------------|:--------------|:------------------------|
| `$uri`          | Collector URI                          | Yes           | Non-empty string  |
| `$protocol`     | Collector Protocol (HTTP or HTTPS)     | No            | String            |
| `$type`         | Request Type (POST or GET)             | No            | String            |
| `$workers`      | Amount of background workers           | No            | Int               |
| `$timeout`      | Worker Timeout                         | No            | Int or Float      |
| `$buffer_size`  | Amount of events to store before flush | No            | Int               |
| `$debug`        | Whether or not to log errors           | No            | Boolean           |

<a name="emitter-debug">
### 4.5 Emitter Debug Mode

To enable debug mode for any of the emitters, append a boolean to the end of the emitter construction argument like so:

```php
$emitter = new SyncEmitter($collector_uri, "http", "POST", 50, true); # Add true as the last argument!
```

By default, debug mode will create a new directory called `/debug/` in the root of the tracker's directory. It will then create a log file with the following structure; `sync-events-log-[[random number]].log`: i.e. the type of emitter and a randomized number to prevent it from being accidentally overwritten.  

If physically storing the information is not possible due to not having the correct write permissions or simply not wanted it can be turned off by updating the following value in the Constants class:

```php
const DEBUG_LOG_FILES = false;
```

Now all debugging information will be printed to the console.

Every time the events buffer is flushed we will be able to see if the flush was successful. In the case of an error it records the entire event payload the tracker was trying to send, along with the error code.

<a name="non-logged-info" />
#### 4.5.1 Event Specific Information

Debug Mode if enabled will also have the emitter begin storing information internally.  It will store the HTTP response code and the payload for every request made by the emitter.

```php
array(
    "code" => 200,
    "data" => "{"e":"pv","url":"www.example.com","page":"example","refr":"www.referrer.com"}"
)
```

The `data` is stored as a JSON-encoded string. To locally test whether or not your emitters are successfully sending, we can retrieve this information with the following commands:

```php
$emitters = $tracker->returnEmitters(); # Will store all of the emitters as an array.
$emitter = $emitters[0]; # Get the first emitter stored by the tracker
$results = $emitter->returnRequestResults();  # Return the stored results.

# Now that we have results we can work with...
print("Code: ".$results[0]["code"]);
print("Data: ".$results[0]["data"]);
```

This allows you to debug on a request by request basis to ensure that everything is being sent properly.

<a name="turn-it-off" />
#### 4.5.2 Turn Debug Off

As debugging stores a lot of information, we can end debug mode by calling the following command:

```php
$tracker->turnOffDebug();
```

This will stop all logging activity, both to the external files and to the local arrays. We can go one step further though and pass a `true` boolean to the function. This will delete all of the tracker's associated physical debug log files as well as emptying the local arrays within each linked emitter.

```php
$tracker->turnOffDebug(true);
```

<a name="track-an-event" />
## 5. Tracking an Event

Snowplow has been built to enable you to track a wide range of events that occur when users interact with your websites and apps. We are constantly growing the range of functions available so as to capture that data more richly.

Tracking methods supported by the PHP Tracker:

| **Function**                                  | **Description**                                        |
|----------------------------------------------:|:-------------------------------------------------------|
| [`trackPageView`](#page-view)                         | Track and record views of web pages.                   |
| [`trackEcommerceTransaction`](#ecommerce-transaction) | Track an ecommerce transaction                         |
| [`trackScreenView`](#screen-view)                     | Track the user viewing a screen within the application |
| [`trackStructEvent`](#struct-event)                   | Track a Snowplow custom structured event               |
| [`trackUnstructEvent`](#unstruct-event)               | Track a Snowplow custom unstructured event             |

<a name="tracking-options">
### 5.1 Optional Tracking Arguments

<a name="custom-context" />
#### 5.1.1 Custom Context

Custom contexts let you add additional information about any circumstances surrounding an event in the form of a PHP Array of name-value pairs. Each tracking method accepts an additional optional contexts parameter after all the parameters specific to that method:

```php
public function trackPageView($page_url, $page_title = NULL, $referrer = NULL, $context = NULL, $tstamp = NULL)
```

An example of a Context Array Structure:

```php
array(
    "schema" => "iglu:com.acme_company/movie_poster/jsonschema/2.1.1",
    "data" => array(
        "movie_name" => "Solaris", 
        "poster_country" => "JP"
    )
)
```

This is how to fire a page view event with the above custom context:

```php
$tracker->trackPageView(
    "http://www.films.com", 
    "Homepage", 
    NULL,
    array(
        "schema" => "iglu:com.acme_company/movie_poster/jsonschema/2.1.1",
        "data" => array(
            "movie_name" => "Solaris", 
            "poster_country" => "JP"
        )
    )
);
```

Each tracking method supports an optional timestamp as its final argument; this allows you to manually override the timestamp attached to this event. The timestamp should be in **milliseconds** since the Unix epoch.

If you do not pass this timestamp in as an argument, then the PHP Tracker will use the current time to be the timestamp for the event.

Here is an example tracking a structured event and supplying the optional timestamp argument. We can explicitly supply a `NULL` for the intervening arguments which are empty:

```php
$tracker->trackStructEvent("some cat", "save action", NULL, NULL, NULL, 1368725287000);
```

The above example contains an order with two order items.

<a name="ecommerce-item" />
##### 5.2.2.1 `trackEcommerceTransactionItem`

This is a private function that is called from within `trackEcommerceTransaction`. Note that for an item to be added successfully you need to include the following fields in the array, even if the value is `NULL`.

Arguments:

| **Argument**    | **Description**                     | **Required?** | **Validation**           |
|----------------:|:------------------------------------|:--------------|:-------------------------|
| `"sku"`         | Item SKU                            | Yes           | Non-empty string         |
| `"price"`       | Item price                          | Yes           | Int or Float             |
| `"quantity"`    | Item quantity                       | Yes           | Int                      |
| `"name"`        | Item name                           | No            | String                   |
| `"category"`    | Item category                       | No            | String                   |

Example Item:

```php
array(
    array("name" => NULL,
          "category" => NULL,
          "price" => 100,
          "sku" => "sku_1",
          "quantity" => 1)
)
```

If any of these fields are missing the item event will not be created. However the order of these fields is not important.

<a name="screen-view" />
#### 5.2.3 `trackScreenView`

Track a user viewing a screen (or equivalent) within your app.

Function:

```php
public function trackScreenView($name = NULL, $id = NULL, $context = NULL, $tstamp = NULL)
```

Arguments:

| **Argument** | **Description**                     | **Required?** | **Validation**          |
|-------------:|:------------------------------------|:--------------|:------------------------|
| `$name`      | Human-readable name for this screen | No            | Non-empty string        |
| `$id`        | Unique identifier for this screen   | No            | String                  |
| `$context`   | Custom context for the event        | No            | Array                   |
| `$tstamp`    | When the screen was viewed          | No            | Positive integer        |

Although `$name` and `$id` are not individually required, at least one must be provided or the event will fail validation.

Example:

```php
$tracker->trackScreenView("HUD > Save Game", NULL, NULL, 1368725287000);
```

<a name="struct-event" />
#### 5.2.4 `trackStructEvent`

Track a custom event happening in your app which fits the Google Analytics-style structure of having up to five fields (with only the first two required).

Function:
```php
public function trackStructEvent($category, $action, $label = NULL, $property = NULL, $value = NULL, 
                                 $context = NULL, $tstamp = NULL)
```

Arguments:

| **Argument** | **Description**                                                  | **Required?** | **Validation**           |
|-------------:|:---------------------------------------------------------------  |:--------------|:-------------------------|
| `$category`  | The grouping of structured events which this `action` belongs to | Yes           | Non-empty string         |
| `$action`    | Defines the type of user interaction which this event involves   | Yes           | Non-empty string         |
| `$label`     | A string to provide additional dimensions to the event data      | No            | String                   |
| `$property`  | A string describing the object or the action performed on it     | No            | String                   |
| `$value`     | A value to provide numerical data about the event                | No            | Int or Float             |
| `$context`   | Custom context for the event                                     | No            | Array                    |
| `$tstamp`    | When the structured event occurred                               | No            | Positive integer         |

Example:

```php
$tracker->trackStructEvent("shop", "add-to-basket", NULL, "pcs", 2);
```

<a name="unstruct-event" />
#### 5.2.5 `trackUnstructEvent`

Track a custom event which consists of a name and an unstructured set of properties. This is useful when:

* You want to track event types which are proprietary/specific to your business (i.e. not already part of Snowplow), or
* You want to track events which have unpredictable or frequently changing properties

Function:

```php
public function trackUnstructEvent($event_json, $context = NULL, $tstamp = NULL)
```

Arguments:

| **Argument**   | **Description**                      | **Required?** | **Validation**          |
|---------------:|:-------------------------------------|:--------------|:------------------------|
| `$event_json`  | The properties of the event          | Yes           | Array                   |
| `$context`     | Custom context for the event         | No            | Array                   |
| `$tstamp`      | When the unstructured event occurred | No            | Positive integer        |

Example:

```php
$tracker->trackUnstructEvent(
    array(
        "schema" => "com.example_company/save-game/jsonschema/1.0.2",
        "data" => array(
            "save_id" => "4321",
            "level" => 23,
            "difficultyLevel" => "HARD",
            "dl_content" => true 
        )
    ),
    NULL,
    132184654684
);
```

The `$event_json` must be an array with two fields: `schema` and `data`. `data` is a flat array containing the properties of the unstructured event. `schema` identifies the JSON schema against which `data` should be validated.

<a name="extra-functions" />
### 5.3 Extra Tracker Functions

<a name="flush-emitters" />
#### 5.3.1 Tracker `flushEmitters`

The `flushEmitters` function can be called after you have successfully created a Tracker with the following function call:

```php
$tracker->flushEmitters();
```

This will tell the tracker to send any remaining events that are left in the buffer to the collector(s).
