## Overview of Stream Enrich

[Stream Enrich] [stream-enrich] is a Kinesis application, built using the Kinesis Client Library, which:

1. **Reads** raw Snowplow events off a Kinesis stream populated by the Scala Stream Collector
2. **Validates** each raw event
2. **Enriches** each event (e.g. infers the location of the user from his/her IP address)
3. **Writes** the enriched Snowplow event to another Kinesis stream

This guide covers how to setup Stream Enrich, specifically:

1. [Installation](Install-Stream-Enrich) - you need to install Stream Enrich on your own server. It will interact with Amazon Kinesis via the Amazon API
2. [Configuration](Configure-Stream-Enrich) - how to use Stream Enrich at the command line, to instruct it to process data from your collector
3. [Running](Run-Stream-Enrich) - how to run Stream Enrich
