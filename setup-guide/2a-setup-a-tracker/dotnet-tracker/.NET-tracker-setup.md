## 1. Overvew

The [Snowplow .NET Tracker][dotnet-tracker-github] is written in C# and lets you add analytics to your [.NET][dotnet] applications.

Setting up the Tracker should be relatively straightforward if you are familiar with C# development.

## 2. Tracker compatibility

The .NET Tracker is known to be compatible with C# version 4.0.0.0. It introduces two external dependencies: [NLog][nlog] and [Sider][sider].
