## 1. Overview

The [Snowplow Scala Tracker](https://github.com/snowplow/snowplow-scala-tracker) lets you add analytics to your Scala apps and servers.

Setting up the tracker should be relatively straightforward if you are familiar with [sbt][sbt].

<a name="setup" />
## 2. Setup

<a name="hosting" />
### 2.1 Hosting

The Tracker is published to Snowplow's [hosted Maven repository] [maven-snplow], which should make it easy to add it as a dependency into your own Scala app.

<a name="sbt" />
### 2.2 SBT

Add the Scala Tracker to your build.sbt like this:

```scala
resolvers += "Snowplow Releases" at "http://maven.snplow.com/releases/"
libraryDependencies += "com.snowplowanalytics" %% "snowplow-scala-tracker" % "0.2.0"
```

<a name="gradle" />
### 2.3 Gradle

If you are using Gradle in your own Scala application, then add our Maven repository in your `build.gradle` file:

```groovy
repositories {
    ...
    maven {
        url "http://maven.snplow.com/releases"
    }
}
```

Then add into the same file:

```groovy
dependencies {
    ...
    // Snowplow Scala Tracker
    compile 'com.snowplowanalytics:snowplow-scala-tracker_2.10:0.2.0'
}
```

Notice a `_2.10` postfix in artifactId. This is used for Scala libraries and denote Scala version which artifact (in our case `snowplow-scala-tracker`) is compiled against. It also means that this library will bring a `org.scala-lang:scala-library_2.10.x` as transitive dependency and if you're using any other Scala dependency you should keep these postfixes in accordance (`snowplow-scala-tracker` is also compiled against Scala 2.11).

<a name="maven" />
### 2.4 Maven

If you are using Maven for building your Scala application, then add the following code into your `HOME/.m2/settings.xml` to be able to use this repository:

```xml
<settings>
  <profiles>
    <profile>
      <!-- ... -->
      <repositories>
        <repository>
          <id>com.snowplowanalytics</id>
          <name>SnowPlow Analytics</name>
          <url>http://maven.snplow.com/releases</url>
          <releases>
            <enabled>true</enabled>
          </releases>
          <snapshots>
            <enabled>true</enabled>
          </snapshots>
        </repository>
      </repositories>
    </profile>
  </profiles>
</settings>
```

Then add into your project's `pom.xml`:

```xml
<dependency>
    <groupId>com.snowplowanalytics</groupId>
    <artifactId>snowplow-scala-tracker_2.10</artifactId>
    <version>0.2.0</version>
</dependency>
```

Notice a `_2.10` postfix in artifactId. This is used for Scala libraries and denote Scala version which artifact (in our case `snowplow-scala-tracker`) is compiled against. It also means that this library will bring a `org.scala-lang:scala-library_2.10.x` as transitive dependency and if you're using any other Scala dependency you should keep these postfixes in accordance (`snowplow-scala-tracker` is also compiled against Scala 2.11).

Done? Now read the [Scala Tracker API](Scala-Tracker) to start tracking events.
