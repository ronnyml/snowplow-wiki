<a name="compatibility" />
### 2.1 Tracker compatibility

The Snowplow AS3 Tracker has been built, tested and compiled using the Adobe Flex 3.5 SDK, but is not dependent on Flex. You can use it in pure Actionscript projects.

It is compatible with Flash Player 9.0.124 and later.

### 2.2 Dependencies

There are no external dependencies. The FlashBuilder project includes any necessary external classes, and the binary swc file is standalone, ready to be included in your project and referenced in your AS3 code.

## 3. Setup

<a name="hosting" />
### 3.1 Hosting

The Tracker is available as source code for inclusion and compilation in your project, or as a binary .SWC file which you can just add to your project as is.

The binary is published to Snowplow's [hosted Bintray repository][bintray-snowplow-as3].

The source code is available on [Snowplow's GitHub repository][github-snowplow-as3].

The current version of the Snowplow AS3 Tracker is 0.1.0.

### 3.2 FlashBuilder

If you are using FlashBuilder for building your Flash application, then either:

1. Download the binary (.SWC) file and include it in your project under "Properties > Build Path > Library Path > Add SWC..."  

or 

2. Download the project source code and import the FlashBuilder project using "Import > Other... > Existing Projects into Workspace". Then link this new project to your project using "Properties > Build Path > Library Path > Add Project..."

Done? Now read the [Actionscript 3 Tracker API](./ActionScript3-Tracker) to start tracking events.
